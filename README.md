Along with this submission is a file “run_analysis.R” which:

	Part i. Basically, cleaning your R environment.
	Part ii. Load the necessary R Library
	Part iii. Checking, Creating and Unzipping the file to the desired directory
	Part iv. Checking and listing all the files inside the UCI HAR Dataset folder
	
ASSIGNMENT 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
Passing the values the txt files into the data set. 
Merging the data sets to create one data set.

ASSIGNMENT 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Calling the names of the data set with its measurement and use the mean/std deviation. 
Concatenating the data set to the specified subject and activity. 

ASSIGNMENT 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. 
Passing the descriptive activity name from a text file to a data set. 

ASSIGNMENT 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

ASSIGNMENT 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The required output file is named “tidydata.txt”
